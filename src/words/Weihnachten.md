# Weihnachten

## Meaning and Usage

“Weihnachten” refers to Christmas, the annual festival commemorating the birth of Jesus Christ, observed primarily on December 25th as a religious and cultural celebration among billions of people around the world. In the German-speaking context, Weihnachten is a time for family gatherings, traditional foods, Christmas markets, and decorations, including the Christmas tree, or “Weihnachtsbaum.”

## Linguistic Analysis

“Weihnachten” is a compound noun derived from the Middle High German “wīhenahten,” which means “consecrated night” or “holy night.” The word breaks down into two elements: “weihen,” which means “to consecrate,” and “Nacht” which means “night.”

## Comparisons between German and English

The English word “Christmas” derives from the Old English “Cristes mæsse,” which means “Christ’s mass.” Unlike the German term, which emphasizes the night and its sanctity, the English term focuses on the mass or religious service dedicated to Christ.

## Cultural Context

Weihnachten is deeply embedded in German culture, with its own set of customs and traditions. Famous for its Christmas markets (Weihnachtsmärkte), Germany celebrates the season with a variety of regional foods, crafts, and the advent of the Advent calendar, which counts down the days until Christmas.

## Example Sentences

1. “An Weihnachten kommen alle Familienmitglieder zusammen.” (At Christmas, all family members come together.)
2. “Kinder freuen sich auf Geschenke unter dem Weihnachtsbaum an Weihnachten.” (Children look forward to gifts under the Christmas tree at Christmas.)
3. “Die Weihnachtsmärkte in Deutschland sind weltberühmt.” (The Christmas markets in Germany are world-famous.)

## Memory Tips

To remember “Weihnachten,” think of the night before Christmas being a “holy night” or “consecrated night,” which is the literal translation of the German components of the word.
