## Linguistic Analysis
"Dessen" is a demonstrative pronoun that does not change its form based on the gender, number, or case of the noun it refers to. It is derived from the Middle High German "des, dessen, dem, den" and can be traced back to the Proto-Germanic word "þas, þes, þis," meaning "this" or "that."
