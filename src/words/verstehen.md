## Linguistic Analysis
"Verstehen" is an infinitive form of the verb. It is a combination of the prefix "ver-" and the root "stehen." The prefix "ver-" often indicates a completion or thoroughness of an action, and "stehen" means "to stand." Together, "verstehen" emphasizes the thoroughness of understanding. The word's etymology comes from the Old High German word "farstaan," from "far-" (away) and "staan" (stand).

## Comparisons between German and English

## Cultural Context
In German culture, the value of understanding and comprehension is highly prized, and "verstehen" is used not only to express literal understanding but also to convey empathy and insight into others' emotions and viewpoints.

## Example Sentences
- Ich verstehe, was du meinst. (I understand what you mean.)
