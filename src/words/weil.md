## Meaning and Usage
"Weil" is a subordinating conjunction in German, which means "because" in English. It is used to introduce the reason for something or to connect two clauses, indicating cause and effect.

## Linguistic Analysis
"Weil" does not have a prefix, root, or suffix. It is derived from Middle High German and can be traced back to the Old High German word "wila," meaning "wile" or "time." 

## Comparisons between German and English
The German "weil" corresponds to the English "because." Both words are used to connect reasons or causes to consequences in a sentence.

## Example Sentences
1. Ich war müde, weil ich gestern spät aufgeblieben bin. (I was tired because I stayed up late yesterday.)
2. Wir gehen nicht spazieren, weil es regnet. (We are not going for a walk because it's raining.)

Associate "weil" with the English word "while" to remember that it introduces a cause-and-effect relationship in a sentence.
